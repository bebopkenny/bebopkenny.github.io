My first semester taking a computer science class. Hope to graduate in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120 L Labs

Lab 4

I enjoyed creating the Hilo game because it dealt with if statements. In this lab, I fully understood how to utilize if statements and how I can create a game or any other activity with it. this interactive game involves users attempting to deduce a secret number, with the flow of the game being controlled by strategically placed if statements. Upon user input, if statements come into play to evaluate the guessed number relative to the secret one. For instance, if the user's guess exceeds the secret number, the program provides feedback stating "too high," and conversely, if it falls short, it responds with "too low." These if statements not only govern the game's progression but also introduce a decision-making framework, influencing user interactions.

Lab 1

Although this lab is extremely easy for me now, it was very difficult and confusing at the time. Printing out “Hello World” has come a long way for me. While creating the program, I was stressed and took the whole class period to write the sentence in Visual Studio. After leaving class, I thought it was going to be very difficult for me to learn how to program. I was scared of the thought of getting left behind, considering how easy the first lab was. Now, I am able to formulate a double for loop vector and read code. It is incredible to know how far I’ve gotten in my programming journey. Lab 1 is a reminder to myself not to give up, and with hard work and dedication, I am able to achieve my goal of graduating with a CS degree.

Lab 6

Creating the blackjack game was an immensely enjoyable experience for me, given my enthusiasm for playing the game at casinos. The prospect of developing a program capable of simulating a game of blackjack was something I hadn't initially anticipated. Despite encountering challenges while navigating the intricacies of implementing the appropriate if statements into the program, the process was undeniably thrilling, offering me valuable insights into the mechanics of game development. The challenges mainly revolved around devising and implementing the correct if statements to capture the nuanced rules and decision-making processes inherent in blackjack. However, overcoming these challenges was not only rewarding but also provided a sense of accomplishment in understanding how the intricate layers of the game could be replicated in code.
